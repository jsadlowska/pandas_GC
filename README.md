Analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds in Neoscona adianta Using GC-MS and Pandas

Overview:

This project is part of my master's thesis, where I aimed to identify volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by male and female Neoscona adianta using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The data was analyzed using Python with the Pandas library to process, clean, and analyze the GC-MS results. The goal of the project is to compare the chemical profiles between male and female spiders to understand differences in VOC production.

Project Structure:

The project consists of the following Jupyter Notebooks:

    1_Data_preparation.ipynb  
    2_Concentrations_of_chemical_compounds.ipynb  
    3_Dixon's_Q_Test.ipynb  
    4_Final_results.ipynb
